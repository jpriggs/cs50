1.  stdint.h is a header file that allows the programmer to specify typedefs that can manipulate values at certain memory locations.
2.  They're aliases for integer types that set unsigned bits to set integer sizes so they are consistent across different hardware 
    and environments
3.  BYTE = 1 byte, DWORD = 4 bytes, LONG = 4 bytes, WORD = 2 bytes.
4.  In hexidecimal BM: B = 0x42, M = 0x4D.
5.  bfSize is the total size in bytes of the .bmp file, and biSize is the number of bytes in the header file.
6.  A top-down DIB (device-independent bitmap) is used and the origin start from the upper left corner. And it cannot be compressed.
7.  biBitCount
8.  If it can't find (read) the file in line 24 or output (write) to a file in line 32, it will return a NULL result error.
9.  Specifies the number of elements in a file read by fread, which is just 1 element from each header file represented in lines 42 
    and 46 in copy.c
10. Based on mod 4, it will return a value of 1 (byte).
11. fseek is a function that changes the location of the file pointer within the program and the offset changes how many bytes you 
    want to move the pointer over.
12. SEEK_CUR changes the pointer location based on the offset.
